    <h1>Fatima A M</h1>

    <h2>Test Engineer</h2>
    <p id="testing">I am Fatima and I have been testing software since 2005, when I got a job with an independent testing company straight out of college. I have worked in India, UK, Ireland, and USA, interacting with a wide variety of people, team structures, and work cultures.</p>

<p>In 2020, I worked on teams as a freelance tester for a short while. This was a great opportunity for me to take up my work with a greater oversight on how to test (process, tools) with minimal direction, and to hone my own testing knowledge.</p>

    <p>I have worked in Functional Testing projects for the complete testing lifecycle for various application domains. I have engaged with different testing organizations gaining an all round view of testing. Within my projects, I strive to understand associated business requirements and technology-business integration needs. I have handled test project leadership, coordination, and reporting across multiple client organizations.</p>

    <p>Some of the project domains I have tested:
      <ol>
	<li>Population genomics</li>
	<li>Data-driven, predictive software that informed clinicians of radiation oncology treatment plan outcomes in real-time</li>
	<li>Converged datacenter infrastructure solutions</li>
	<li>Mortgages platform</li>
	<li>Sales tracking systems, financial planning and analysis, accounts payable, Customer Relationship Management, and knowledge management software</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

<p>My specialties in the context of testing: Exploratory testing, Project management, Documentation, Research and analysis, Process design and re-engineering, Requirements elicitation and verification.</p>

    <p>My testing ‚öíÔ∏è : Taking immense quantities of screenshots, obsessively combing through back-end logs and timestamps, and have worked with
      <ul>
	<li>Test Automation tools:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>JavaScript + Playwright,</li>
	  <li>Java + Selenium,</li>
	  <li>Python + Robot Framework,</li>
	 </ul>
	<li><em>Git,</em></li>
	<li>Postman</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Programmer</h2>
    <p>Learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java. I want to gain expertise in either user experience design, or back-end design, not sure which.</p>

    <h2>Creative Writer</h2>
    <p>I am also an author of short stories, fiction, and non-fiction, focusing on writing about experiences of women, childhoods, roots, and a migratory life. üñãÔ∏èüìñ</p>
