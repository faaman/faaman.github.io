    <h1>Fatima A M</h1>

    <h2>Test Engineer</h2>
        <p id="testing">I am Fatima and I have been testing software since 2005, when I got a job with an independent testing company straight out of college. I have worked in India, UK, Ireland, and USA, interacting with a wide variety of people, team structures, and work cultures.</p>

        <p>In 2020, I worked on teams as a freelance tester for a short while. This was a great opportunity for me to take up my work with a greater oversight on how to test (process, tools) with minimal direction, and to hone my own testing knowledge.</p>

        <p>I have worked in Functional Testing projects for the complete testing lifecycle for various application domains. I have engaged with different testing organizations gaining an all round view of testing. Within my projects, I strive to understand associated business requirements and technology-business integration needs. I have handled test project leadership, coordination, and reporting across multiple client organizations.</p>

        <p>Some of the project domains I have tested:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Population genomics</li>
	    <li>Data-driven, predictive software that informed clinicians of radiation oncology treatment plan outcomes in real-time</li>
	    <li>Converged datacenter infrastructure solutions</li>
	    <li>Mortgages platform</li>
	    <li>Sales tracking systems, financial planning and analysis, accounts payable, Customer Relationship Management, and knowledge management software</li>
	  </ol>


        <p>My specialties in the context of testing: Exploratory testing, Project management, Documentation, Research and analysis, Process design and re-engineering, Requirements elicitation and verification.</p>
