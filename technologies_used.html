      <h2>CURRENTLY LEARNING AND USING</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span class="tool">Head First HTML and CSS, Head First JavaScript</span>, <span class="usage">at the moment all the html and css that you see on my pages are from coding along this book. <s>I won't lie and say that I love all the color combinations going on, but better times will surely come soon.</s> Slightly better times are here!! <br>I had earlier used this book series to complete my PMP certification. The reason I like the Head First books: I don't actually need so much graphics, but I think at this stage of my life, my attention span has dwindled. So this book is very useful. Also using this book, I can build out an actual project right now. While learning HTML I mostly skipped the additional exercises, but when I studied for PMP, I did everything in the book completely. It is a great resource to solidify the learning. It is not an in-depth book or a reference book, but it will start you off wihout the feeling of not accomplishing anything substantial to show for, like how I feel with online tutorial websites.</span></li>

        <h2>TEST AUTOMATION SKILLS</h2>
      </p>
      <ul>
<li>Learnt programming in college (4 years) and done test automation (2 years) at work.</li>
<li>Have a solid understanding of OOP concepts..</li>
<li>Can find repeatable checks in the Application under Test, that can be automated..</li>
<li>Can generate Regression tests that can then be used as automated checks..</li>
<li>Have tested web services API using Postman, and databases using SQL tools. Hence I can create checks for testing these which can then be automated.</li>
<li>Have used the Jenkins-ROBOT framework plugin to integrate my automation suite into the daily scheduled regression runs.</li>
<li>Have used the above run results to triage test automation failures, and to identify possible defects in the actual development code. Also used Linux system logs for the same.</li>
<li>Used Github and the Git command line</li>
